## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I finished both the basic lessons on javascipt and html. I learned about the basic structures and syntax of each of the languages, and also figured out how they both interacted with each other.

## This Week's Plan
> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I want to start on the actual registration site. I am going to implement the drop down and the normal text input boxes. I will also need to find a way to store the information that gets inputed.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Since I just learned the basics of both html and javascript, I still need to keep on learning more on my own as I'm working on the project.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
