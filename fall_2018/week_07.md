## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Implemented the basic drop down and text input boxes on the website. Our group doesn't know how to implement a database yet so I just stored the information onto the sites local storage.

## This Week's Plan
> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Try to add an extra option the drop down menu on the main site so that one can access the registration site. Also work on the scheduele section on the website.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

>A couple of weeks ago I updated my environment and after I updated I had to set up my environment again. I haven't been using the actual shuttle tracker application since I just had to work on the site. Becuase of this I haven't set it back up again. Also our group has not implemented a database yet.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
