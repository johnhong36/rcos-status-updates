## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I started working on the post fragment. I didn't have too much time so all I was able to complete were a couple of textboxes that receieved some information from the user. Although working with a fragment and a normal activity was different so I had to spend a bit of time reseaching how to work on fragments. The fragments were created by another team member. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For this week I hope I can just get some more progress on the post fragment. More specifically add more textboxes for the user to input data into. I may also try to change a couple of the textboxes into drop down option menus so that users can input data more easily. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> As I stated before, at first I had a bit of trouble working on the fragment since they are different from activities. Although I was able to get some work on them, I still have a couple of questions so during the next small groyp I am going to talk to the team member who worked on the fragments on the main activtiy. We also still don't have a working database so all of our lages are not 100 percent complete yet.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
