## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I continued working on the post fragment. I added more textboxes for input. However I was not able start converting a couple of them into drop down options. Instead I started working on a message that pop-ups after you add all the confirmation and click the post button. This pop-up message just shows the user that their post has been posted on the main hub fragment. I also decided to look into mongoDB myself so that maybe I can try to implemenet it. If I am not able to I may also start to look for other options for our database, that are easy to use and add. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For this week I hope I can finish the pop-up message for the post fragment. I also hope I can start working on the drop down menus options. I haven't worked with them before so I am probably going to have to a decent of reseach into them. Also as I stated before I have started looking into mongoDB and hopefully I can either implement it or find another database that we can use.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I do not have any blockers other than not having a database.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
