## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This week instead of working on the FireBase authentication and database implementation I decided to work on the hub fragment. This hub fragment is the main aprt of our app. In this fragment, users are going to be able to see the posts about rides to different locations. Each posts will contain information such as the starting and final locations, times, and how many other people they are looking for. If a user see's a post that they want to go on, they will have to click on the post and agree to join the group. So far I have added a datatype called a ListView on the fragment. With the ListView I can add objects in a list and the list will be shown on the fragment. Each object can be clicked on and it is scrollable. So far I can only add strings but in future I will be creating a post object that will be added instead. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week I hope I can create a post object and and make it so that the list accepts these post objects instead of strings. Also hopefully I can format the list so that all the information is shown on each of the cells instead of just one string.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Implementing FireBase has been dificult because it is hard to tell what the error is since the app just crashes without any messages.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
