## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I haven't been able to do too much this week due to other responsibilities. However the android team has started to discuss what we are going to do in the following Summer semester of RCOS. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> My plans for this week are the same as last week. I want to create a post object that is added to the ListView datatype on the hub fragment. This post object would contain all the neccessary information on the ride itself. I also hope I can start on the formating of the information on the actual hub.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Other than FireBase, none.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
