## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I attempted to finish a pop-up message for when a user posts a GroupRide request. However after working on it for a while and looking all over the internet I decided that the time put into just a pop-up message was not worth it. It seemes like the problem was that I was trying to add a pop-up message on a fragment instead of a activity. Most of the research I did online was about pop-messages for activies. So instead I decided to work on fleshing out the Post fragment. I added drop menus for the time of the pick up. So to input the hours/minute/AP,PM the user needs to select their options from a drop down menu. This was my first time implementing drop down menus so this took a while to figure out. Another feature I added was an "Additional Message" input text box. This was added so that users can also add a short message on their post. For example, if a user has very strict time constraints they could add "We need to leave exactly at HH:MM." 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For this week I want to try to work on setting up FireBase on Android studio. Although we didn't have too much success in the past, since the IOS team is also using FireBase we also proabably need to use it was well. Before we actually start coding the android team is going to have to more research before trying to adding it. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Although I already talked about this in the accomplishments section, trying to add a pop-up message on a fragment instead of an actiivity gave me alot of trouble. I also may not be able to do too much this week because of other work and prepping for our RCOS presentation.
