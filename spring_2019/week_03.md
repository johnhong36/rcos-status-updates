## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I did not do much in terms of coding but instead looked more into Firebase implenentation with Android Studio. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I hope by the end of this week I will be able to transport all the infromation inputted into the registration page directly into a Firebase server. I also want to alter the login page so that when a user tries to login, the program checks whether or not the inputted username and password matches with a valid set of username and password on the Firebase server. This will require me to learn how to input and export data from a Firebase database.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't have alot of experience working with databases and servers so my progress in learning how to use them is slow. I will try to talk to my other groupmates in IOS who have already implemented this on the IOS version.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
