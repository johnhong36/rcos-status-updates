## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I finished the implementation of the email confirmation page. This is a page that prompts the user to go to their email and validate their account after they have created an account. I attempted to finish this a couple of weeks ago but stopped for a while due to a bug I couldn't fix. However this week I was able to find the bug and finished it. All it has is some text and a button that redirects the user back to the login page. I was contemplating between a pop-up message or this email confirmation page but decided that the page was a bit more clear.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For this week I want to start working on the post fragment on the main activity page. On the main activity page there are three fragments which all act as different parts of the app. The three fragments are post, hub and account. On the post fragment, users are going to be able to input information about the type of ride they would want to have. Some examples of information they would be inputting is their starting and ending destinations, and time. Although I probably can't finish this all in one week I hope to just get a start. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Since the database side of the team has been struggling with setting up a working database with android studio, we have decided to try out mongoDB. The android team not having a database has been tough because we cant fully implement our pages. Hopefully we will make a decision or have some progress by this week.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
