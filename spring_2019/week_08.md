## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I tried to implement FireBase on Android Studio again. However I have not had too much success. Although I have been following online guides step by step I am not getting anywhere. It is difficult to know what my error is because the app is compiling but whenever I try to open up the activity that is trying to use FIreBase the app just closes. I was able to find that the method getInstance() is causing the app to close but I don't know why this function is making it close. I have looked online for a solution to this problem but I have gotten multiple "solutions" that have not been to helpful. Another part that I worked on was reformatting the Post page a bit so it looks better.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For this week, hopefully I can figure out what is causing the app to close whenever it tries to use the function getInstance(). However it is not looking to good because I have looked at many forum posts and videos, and still have not found anything that is helpful. If I can't figure this out, then I may just try to start working on the Hub fragment. I want to add an example cell of a post so that we can see what a post would look like. This cell would contain all the information that was put in the Post fragment.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Finding a solution to the getInstance() problem has been a huge blocker for me this week. Because of this problem I can't see if the rest of my code about FireBase works. ALthough the IOS side has already implemented FIreBase, implementing on Android Studio and XCode are significantly different. Because of this I probably can't get too much help from them. 

## Notes
