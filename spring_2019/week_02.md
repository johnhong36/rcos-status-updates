## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Last week, I worked on the registration page. On the registration page I added boxes that users input their information into. Some of the imformation that was inputted was name, email, username and passwords. After the user adds all the necessary information, they click the create button and they are sent to the login page. However before they are sent to the login page, the program checks whether the 2 passwords that the user inputs are the same. I tried to implement a registartion confirmation page but I was getting an unknown error I could not fix. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I plan on trying to finish up the registration confirmation page. The user is sent to this page after they finish inputting their information for their account. The page just states that the user needs to confirm their account on their rpi email to finish their account creation. Then the user clicks on a button on this page and then they are sent to the login page.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The error I am getting is not very clear so I will need to do some research to fix it.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
