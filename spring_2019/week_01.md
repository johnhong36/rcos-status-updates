## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Last week, the first thing I did was I linked the login page to the main hub page. Before this week we had a login page that had a login button that did nothing. I made changes so that when the correct information was added to the ID and password boxes, and the login button was pressed, the user would be sent to the main hub page. The next activity I worked on was similar to the first but instead of connecting to the login page to the hub, I linked the main page to the registration page. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I plan on creating the registration page. Currently the reigstration page that the user is sent to is empty. I also want to start to work on adding the information inputted onto databases.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> The team members who are in charge of the databases are still setting up the databases. Once they are done I will be able to start to fully implement the registration and login page.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
